==============================

{{cookiecutter.description}}

Feel free to delete the below generic reference info and replace with your project info.
Good things to put in here are a statement of the research question, steps to solve it, info about data and algorithms, etc.

You don't need to use all of the directories that are created.
In fact, most projects won't.
Go ahead and delete what you don't need.
